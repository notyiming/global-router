# global-router
The Global Router project is a VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) global router that has been implemented using Python. The goal of the project is to solve the global routing problem, which is known to be NP-hard. To improve the solution, the project has incorporated the use of randomization and parallelization.

One of the key features of the Global Router project is its ability to visualize the congestion map of the layout. This allows users to identify areas of the design where there may be congestion or potential issues, enabling them to optimize the layout and improve performance.

Overall, the Global Router project is a powerful tool for VLSI designers, providing a fast and efficient way to solve the global routing problem and optimize layout designs. With its advanced features and capabilities, it is a valuable asset for any team working in the field of VLSI design.
